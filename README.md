# SkinDetection
Skin Cancer lesion detection system

Here is my code repository for this project, to run a basic UI and use this program, please clone this repository and then run main.py (The essential files are CNN.py, params.pkl, params.pkl & main.py)

To run this code, please make sure you have all requirements installed and then run main.py. Then open a web-browser and open the site localhost:5000.

Once on the UI, open the detection tab and input a square image and then the terminal will output your parameters and the classification of melanoma.
