This folder consists of all the different machine learning algorithms that were experimented with in this project.

The file models consists of the preprocessing, analysis and access of the Ham10000 image set as well as some initial data models, such as: Linear Regression, Logisitc Regression and a Neural Network which have been coded as close to the maths as possible. (Motivation for this explained in NEA.pdf)
                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
Additionally, I have attatched the file CNN_debug which contains most of the code for the CNN while it was in development stage therefore some examples of hyperparameter tuning can be seen here. As well as the convergence graphs for some of there values. (Extended conditions and graphs can be found in NEA.pdf)
